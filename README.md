# crypto-chapel

This is a cryptographic library implemented in Chapel, using OpenSSL crypto primitives. Right now this library is in testing and the interface is expected to change quite often before the first release. If you have any suggestions about the API, algorithms we should support or anything else, please open an Issue and let us know.

# Usage

You should be able to use the library including (in the compiler invocation or with a "require" statement) the Crypto.chpl file. In the "examples" directory some simple applications that use our library are provided.

An installation of the OpenSSL library and headers are required.
